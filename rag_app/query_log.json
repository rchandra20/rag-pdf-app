    "query": "Who is Jane Doe?",
    "answer": "**Who is Jane Doe?**\n\nJane Doe is a placeholder name used in legal and other contexts to refer to a female individual whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld. This practice is commonly used in the United States and Canada. Here are some key points about the use of \"Jane Doe\":\n\n- **Legal Context**: Jane Doe is used in legal actions, cases, or discussions where the identity of a female party needs to be kept anonymous. This is similar to the use of \"John Doe\" for males or \"Baby Doe\" for children [Source 1, Source 2].\n- **Variations**: Other variations of the name may be used depending on the context or to avoid confusion. For example, \"Jane Roe\" is also used, and if multiple anonymous parties are involved, they may be labeled as Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2, etc. [Source 2].\n- **Geographical Usage**: The use of \"Jane Doe\" is prevalent in the United States and Canada. In other English-speaking countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, different placeholder names such as \"Jane Smith\" or \"Jane Bloggs\" are used [Source 1].\n- **Cultural References**: The name \"Jane Doe\" is also used in popular culture to represent an average or typical female, similar to how \"John Q. Public\" is used for a typical male [Source 3].\n\nIn summary, Jane Doe is a widely recognized placeholder name used to represent an unidentified or anonymous female in various contexts, particularly in legal settings.",

    "query": "What is a 2-tier system",
    "answer": "A two-tier system in the context of the Board of Public Accountants refers to a licensing structure that distinguishes between two levels of certification for accountants. Specifically, this system includes:\n\n1. **Certificate Only**: This is the lower tier and is often used by foreign applicants who do not reside in the US and have difficulty obtaining a US CPA to attest to their experience. However, Montana residents can also apply for this certificate. This tier is considered confusing to the public because it does not fully convey the same qualifications and restrictions as a full license to practice [Source 1].\n\n2. **Permit to Practice (License)**: This is the higher tier and requires applicants to meet the \"4 Es\" \u2014 Education, Examination, Experience, and Ethics. This tier allows individuals to practice public accounting fully [Source 1].\n\n### Key Points About the Two-Tier System:\n\n- **Public Confusion**: The Board of Public Accountants considers the two-tier system confusing to the public. Many people assume that a \"certificate only\" holder has the same qualifications as a fully licensed CPA, which is not the case [Source 1].\n\n- **Transition Period**: The draft legislation includes a transition period for current \"certificate only\" licensees to obtain the necessary experience to elevate to the permit to practice level. This experience requirement includes 2,000 hours of accounting and auditing functions within the preceding three years, attested to by a US CPA in good standing [Source 2].\n\n- **Experience Requirements**: The experience can come from various sources, including private, governmental, academic, or public accounting work. The attesting CPA does not need to be a supervisor but must be familiar with the applicant's work and confirm that it meets professional standards [Source 2].\n\n- **Military Experience**: The Board may also consider military experience by evaluating information provided by the applicant's commanding officer, outlining the duties and responsibilities of the applicant while in military service [Source 5].\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\nThe Board of Public Accountants is moving towards legislation (HB44) that would change Montana from a two-tier licensing state to a one-tier state. This change aims to eliminate the confusion surrounding the two-tier system by requiring all applicants to qualify for a permit to practice (license) [Source 1].\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe two-tier system in Montana's licensing structure for public accountants has been identified as a source of public confusion. The proposed legislation aims to streamline the process by moving to a one-tier system, where all accountants would need to meet the same rigorous standards to practice publicly. This change is intended to clarify the qualifications and restrictions for accountants in the state [Source 1, Source 2].",
